# passwordGENERATED
The purpose of this project is to complete some code to generate a password that will have parameters chosen by the user.

A series of prompts will guide the user through generating a randomized password. They will have the option to include lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers and or special characters.

The user will decide to include which characters by clicking ok for yes, or cancel for no. 

If no options are selected then the user will have to start the process over.
